# SQL Learning Journey with PostgreSQL 🚀

## Welcome! 👋
This repository documents my SQL learning journey, where I explore the power of relational databases using **PostgreSQL** on **pgAdmin 4**. Through structured exercises and hands-on queries, I am building a strong foundation in SQL, enhancing my data management and analysis skills.

## Learning Roadmap 📌
This journey is not just about writing queries—it's about understanding how databases work and how SQL helps us extract meaningful insights from data. Here’s what I’m covering:

### ✅ Completed Topics:
- **Selection & Filtering**: Mastering `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and filtering techniques.
- **Joins & Relationships**: Understanding different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`) and how they connect tables.
- **Subqueries**: Learning to nest queries for more dynamic data retrieval.
- **CASE Statements**: Using conditional logic within SQL queries.

### 🎯 Upcoming Topics:
- **SQL Building Blocks**: Mastering constraints, indexing, and best practices.
- **Aggregations & Grouping**: Utilizing `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.).
- **Deep Dive into Relational Databases**: Exploring normalization, data integrity, and database optimization techniques.

## Repository Structure 📂
Each SQL script corresponds to a specific learning module:
```
📁 SQL_Exercises
   ├── selection_queries.sql
   ├── joins_practice.sql
   ├── subqueries_exploration.sql
   ├── case_statements.sql
   ├── (more to come!)
```

## Why This Journey? 🌍
SQL is the backbone of data-driven decision-making. Whether in **Data Science**, **Software Engineering**, or **Business Analytics**, mastering SQL is a key skill. This repository serves as a **progress tracker** and a **resource** for anyone learning SQL with PostgreSQL.
