# SQL Lab - Select and Filter Data

## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries designed to practice selecting and filtering data from a database. The exercises focus on retrieving specific information from a `movies` table, applying conditions, and using aggregate functions.

## Contents
The SQL file **lab1_Amir_11.03.sql** includes:
- Basic `SELECT` queries
- Filtering using `WHERE`
- Using `COUNT()` and `DISTINCT`
- Retrieving data based on conditions (e.g., movies released after a certain year, specific genres)

Additionally, this repository includes the **movies database**, which provides a structured dataset for running queries and practicing SQL commands.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd your-repository
   ```
3. Import the `movies` database into your PostgreSQL server.
4. Open `lab1_Amir_11.03.sql` in your preferred SQL editor or execute the queries in **pgAdmin**, **DBeaver**, or any PostgreSQL-compatible environment.
5. Run each query to explore and analyze the `movies` dataset.

## Requirements
- PostgreSQL installed on your system
- Import the provided `movies` database
- Ensure the `movies` table contains appropriate columns
